# `DoctorsCare SpringBoot Application`<br>

## Introduction:

DoctorsCare is an application that helps its patients to have health care and aids online. It's a website that helps its users to have medical services from their homes. As technology has changed a lot over the last decade, people are trying to cope with new technology and new services. DoctorsCare is one of them which has bright opportunities both for patients and doctors in the future. Because people are updating themselves with technology and becoming more aware of their time. DoctorsCare is a project which values people's time and cost.

So by using DoctorsCare,  people don't need to come to the hospital and wait in a long line to have their medical aid. They can have the best aid from their home. Also in the traditional system, the patients may lose their prescriptions. For this, the doctors were unable to view the patient's previous medical reports. But as all pieces of information are saved in the DoctorsCare application database so there is no chance of losing any information. Which will help both doctors and patients to ensure better treatment.
